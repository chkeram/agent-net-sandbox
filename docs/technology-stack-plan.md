# Multi-Technology Agent Sandbox: Technology Stack Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the technology stack strategy for the Multi-Protocol Agent Sandbox, embracing the project's core philosophy of experimentation and technology comparison. Each agent will demonstrate different LLM frameworks and libraries while maintaining protocol compliance, creating a true sandbox for evaluating various approaches to agent development.

## Core Philosophy

The sandbox serves as a testing ground to:
- Compare different LLM orchestration frameworks
- Evaluate protocol implementations
- Measure performance across technology stacks
- Learn best practices from each ecosystem
- Demonstrate interoperability between diverse technologies

## Architecture Principles

### Two-Layer Separation

1. **Protocol Layer** (Strict Compliance Required)
   - Must use protocol-specific SDKs
   - Ensures interoperability between agents
   - Handles agent-to-agent communication

2. **Implementation Layer** (Technology Freedom)
   - Choice of LLM framework
   - Business logic implementation
   - Internal orchestration patterns

## Technology Stack by Agent

### 1. Multi-Protocol Orchestrator Agent

**Purpose**: Central hub for discovering and routing requests to specialized agents

**Technology Stack**:
- **Protocol**: Custom REST API (no specific protocol SDK)
- **LLM Framework**: **Pydantic AI**
- **LLM Providers**: OpenAI GPT-4o, Anthropic Claude
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI
- **Discovery**: Docker labels + HTTP health checks

**Why Pydantic AI**:
- Newest, most Pythonic approach to LLM agents
- Clean abstraction for multi-provider support
- Excellent for routing and decision-making tasks
- Strong typing with Pydantic models

**Implementation Example**:
```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.models.anthropic import AnthropicModel

orchestrator = Agent(
    model=OpenAIModel("gpt-4o"),
    system_prompt="Route requests to appropriate specialized agents"
)
```

### 2. A2A Math Operations Agent

**Purpose**: Mathematical computations with agent-to-agent communication

**Technology Stack**:
- **Protocol**: `a2a-python` SDK (required for A2A)
- **LLM Framework**: **LangChain**
- **Tools**: LangChain Tools for math operations
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI

**Why LangChain**:
- Mature tool/function calling system
- Extensive documentation for mathematical agents
- Easy integration with custom tools
- Chain composition for complex calculations

**Implementation Example**:
```python
from langchain.agents import create_react_agent
from langchain.tools import Tool
from a2a_sdk import A2AServer

math_tools = [
    Tool(name="calculator", func=calculate, description="Perform calculations"),
    Tool(name="algebra", func=solve_equation, description="Solve equations")
]
```

### 3. MCP Context Management Agent (Future)

**Purpose**: Manage conversation context and state across interactions

**Technology Stack**:
- **Protocol**: `fastmcp` (lightweight MCP implementation)
- **LLM Framework**: **LangGraph**
- **State Management**: Built-in LangGraph state
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI

**Why LangGraph**:
- Designed for stateful agent workflows
- Graph-based conversation flow
- Excellent for context management
- Natural fit for MCP's context protocol

**Implementation Example**:
```python
from langgraph import StateGraph, State
from fastmcp import MCPServer

class ConversationState(State):
    context: list[dict]
    current_topic: str
    
workflow = StateGraph(ConversationState)
```

### 4. ACP Workflow Coordination Agent (Future)

**Purpose**: Complex multi-step workflows with internal agent coordination

**Technology Stack**:
- **Protocol**: `agntcy-acp` SDK
- **LLM Framework**: **CrewAI**
- **Workflow**: CrewAI crews and tasks
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI

**Why CrewAI**:
- Built for multi-agent coordination
- Role-based agent design
- Task delegation patterns
- Process workflow templates

**Implementation Example**:
```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from agntcy_acp import ACPServer

researcher = Agent(role="Researcher", goal="Find information")
analyst = Agent(role="Analyst", goal="Analyze data")
crew = Crew(agents=[researcher, analyst])
```

### 5. Custom RAG Agent (Future)

**Purpose**: Retrieval-augmented generation without protocol constraints

**Technology Stack**:
- **Protocol**: Custom REST (no SDK needed)
- **LLM Framework**: **LlamaIndex**
- **Vector Store**: ChromaDB or Pinecone
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI

**Why LlamaIndex**:
- Best-in-class for RAG applications
- Extensive document processing
- Multiple vector store integrations
- Advanced retrieval strategies

## Implementation Patterns

### Protocol Communication

Each agent maintains protocol compliance while using different internal implementations:

```python
# Orchestrator calls ACP agent (using Pydantic AI internally)
async def route_to_acp_agent(request):
    # Internal: Use Pydantic AI for decision making
    decision = await orchestrator.run("Which agent should handle this?")
    
    # External: Use ACP protocol for communication
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(f"http://{agent}:8000/invoke", json=request)
```

### Technology Comparison Metrics

Track and compare:
- Response latency by framework
- Token usage efficiency
- Code complexity metrics
- Developer experience
- Memory/CPU usage

## Benefits of Mixed Technology Approach

1. **Real-World Simulation**: Most production systems use multiple technologies
2. **Best Tool Selection**: Each agent uses the most suitable framework
3. **Learning Opportunity**: Hands-on experience with multiple ecosystems
4. **Performance Comparison**: Direct benchmarking across frameworks
5. **Fallback Options**: If one approach fails, alternatives are available

## Future Expansion Possibilities

### Additional Frameworks to Explore

- **AutoGen**: Microsoft's multi-agent conversation framework
- **Semantic Kernel**: Microsoft's orchestration framework
- **Haystack**: Alternative to LangChain/LlamaIndex
- **DSPy**: Stanford's declarative LLM programming

### Additional Protocols

- **OpenAI Assistants API**: For stateful agents
- **Hugging Face Agents**: For model-specific agents
- **Custom WebSocket**: For real-time communication

## Development Guidelines

### When Adding New Agents

1. **Choose Protocol**: Determine communication requirements
2. **Select Framework**: Pick based on agent's primary function
3. **Maintain Standards**: Follow protocol specifications exactly
4. **Document Choice**: Explain why this technology was selected
5. **Add Metrics**: Include performance tracking from day one

### Technology Selection Criteria

Consider these factors when choosing frameworks:
- **Use Case Fit**: Does the framework excel at this task?
- **Learning Value**: What new concepts does it introduce?
- **Community Support**: Is it well-maintained and documented?
- **Integration Ease**: How well does it work with protocols?
- **Performance**: Does it meet latency/throughput needs?

## Conclusion

This multi-technology approach transforms the agent sandbox into a comprehensive testing ground for modern LLM frameworks. By maintaining protocol compliance while varying implementation technologies, we create a realistic environment for evaluating different approaches to agent development.

The diversity of frameworks ensures developers gain exposure to multiple paradigms while building practical, interoperable agent systems.
