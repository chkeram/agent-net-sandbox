| < 1.0   | ⚠️ Best effort   |

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **Do NOT** create a public issue

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### 2. Report privately

Send details to: **security@[your-domain].com** or create a private security advisory on GitHub.

Include the following information:
- Type of vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if you have one)

### 3. Response timeline

- **24 hours**: Acknowledgment of your report
- **72 hours**: Initial assessment and severity classification
- **7 days**: Detailed response with timeline for fixes
- **30 days**: Resolution or status update

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Environment Variables & Secrets
- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- Use `.env` files for local development (never commit these)
- Use secure secret management in production
- Rotate API keys regularly

#### Docker Security
- Run containers with non-root users when possible
- Use official base images
- Keep base images updated
- Scan images for vulnerabilities

#### Network Security
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use authentication for sensitive endpoints
- Monitor API access and usage

### For Contributors

#### Code Security
- Validate all inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper error handling (don't leak sensitive info)
- Follow secure coding practices

#### Dependencies
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use known secure packages
- Scan for vulnerable dependencies
- Pin dependency versions

#### API Security
- Implement rate limiting
- Use proper authentication
- Validate request payloads
- Sanitize outputs

## 🔍 Security Features

### Current Security Measures

#### Authentication & Authorization
- API key management for LLM providers
- Environment-based configuration
- CORS configuration support

#### Input Validation
- Pydantic models for request validation
- Type checking and serialization
- Input sanitization

#### Logging & Monitoring
- Structured logging (no sensitive data)
- Request/response logging
- Error tracking and monitoring

#### Container Security
- Multi-stage Docker builds
- Minimal base images
- Health checks
- Non-root user configurations where applicable

### Planned Security Enhancements

- [ ] Agent-to-agent authentication
- [ ] Request signing and verification
- [ ] Enhanced input validation
- [ ] Security headers middleware
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning automation
- [ ] Security audit logging

## 🚫 Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Agent Communication**
   - Currently no authentication between agents
   - HTTP communications not encrypted by default
   - Trust-based agent discovery

2. **API Keys**
   - Stored in environment variables
   - No key rotation mechanism
   - Single key per provider

3. **Container Security**
   - Some containers run as root
   - Docker socket access in development

### Mitigation Strategies

- Use HTTPS/TLS in production environments
- Implement network-level security (VPCs, firewalls)
- Regular security audits and updates
- Monitor agent communications
- Use secure container registries

## 📋 Security Checklist

### For Production Deployment

- [ ] Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- [ ] Implement proper authentication
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery
- [ ] Network security (firewalls, VPCs)
- [ ] Secret management system
- [ ] Container security scanning
- [ ] Access logging and monitoring
- [ ] Regular security assessments

### For Development

- [ ] Never commit secrets
- [ ] Use `.env` files for local config
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated
- [ ] Use secure development practices
- [ ] Test security configurations
- [ ] Review code for security issues
- [ ] Use linting and security scanning tools

## 🔧 Security Tools

### Recommended Tools

- **Container Scanning**: Trivy, Clair, Snyk
- **Dependency Scanning**: Safety, Snyk, GitHub Dependabot

# Example security checks in CI/CD
security-scan:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    # Scan for secrets
    - name: Run GitLeaks
      uses: zricethezav/gitleaks-action@v2
      
    # Scan dependencies
    - name: Run Safety
      run: |
        pip install safety
        safety check
        
    # Scan containers
    - name: Run Trivy
      uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
      with:
        image-ref: 'your-image:latest'
```
